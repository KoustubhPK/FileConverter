            Password protecting a PDF document is a crucial security measure that restricts unauthorized access and ensures the confidentiality of sensitive information. By setting a password, users can prevent others from opening, copying, printing, or editing the PDF content without the correct credentials. <strong>This feature is particularly useful when sharing sensitive documents via email or file-sharing platforms, as it adds an extra layer of protection against potential data breaches.</strong> Most PDF readers and editors, as well as online tools, offer the option to add password protection to PDFs, allowing users to customize access permissions and safeguard their confidential data from unauthorized viewers. It is essential to use strong, unique passwords and to keep them secure to maintain the effectiveness of this security measure.

            <strong>Unlocking a PDF refers to the process of removing password protection or restrictions from a password-protected or encrypted PDF document.</strong> When a PDF is locked, it requires the correct password to be entered before the document can be opened, viewed, edited, copied, or printed. Unlocking a PDF becomes necessary when someone with the appropriate permissions forgets the password or when a user needs to access the content without restrictions.<br><br>
            Various tools and software are available to unlock PDFs, but it's essential to remember that attempting to unlock a PDF without the proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Only use PDF unlocking methods for PDFs that you have the legitimate right to access, and always respect the privacy and security of sensitive information.
